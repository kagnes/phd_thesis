# PhD thesis: Particle-verb constructions in Hungarian

The thesis investigates the class of Hungarian verbal particles and the particle-verb constructions by a corpus-driven method. Its main research questions are as follows: (1) Which lexical items can be classified as verbal particles, and what are the grounds of their classification? (2) What kinds of structural patterns do particle-verb constructions show, when and to what extent can a particle be separated from a finite/non-finite verb or a deverbal element? (3) How can we describe the productive particle-verb patterns, and – based on this – what conclusions can be made about the semantics of verbal particles?

## Important note

This PDF is the first version I submitted and it's still under review. Soon I'll replace it with a polished final version which contains modifications suggested by my opponents, and an Acknowledgements section, of course.
