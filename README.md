# PhD thesis: Preverb constructions in Hungarian

The thesis investigates Hungarian preverbs and preverb constructions in a corpus-driven approach. Its main research questions are as follows: (1) Which lexical items can be classified as preverbs, and what can be the grounds of their classification? (2) What kinds of structural patterns do preverb constructions show, when and to what extent can a preverb be separated from a finite/non-finite verb or a deverbal element? (3) How can we describe the productive preverb–verb patterns, and – based on this – what conclusions can be made about the semantics of preverbs?

## Important note

This PDF is the first version I submitted and it's still under review. Soon I'll replace it with a polished final version which contains modifications suggested by my opponents, and an Acknowledgements section, of course.
